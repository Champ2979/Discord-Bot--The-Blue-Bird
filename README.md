# Discord-Bot--The-Blue-Bird
It is a discord bot made by my team in Project exhibition in 3rd semester.
<br>
<p> Nowadays, Discord is gaining popularity & getting famous among youth, it is one of the most 
convenient platforms for students to take help in their academics as well as for their mental 
peace and relaxation. It has some automated processes such as banning inappropriate 
users(accounts) which is vital for the discord community to grow. Bot users are the automated 
programs that look and act like users and automatically respond to events and commands on 
discord.</p><br>
<p> Our project is an approach to provide a server in discord named “THE BLUE BIRD”, the 
server will be helpful to students as we are creating different bots with various function which 
help in there effective learning. Each bot has its own purpose to help students in academics, 
mental health, Interaction, Building connection. “THE BULE BIRD” server be beneficial for 
engineering students in building their career in various fileds.</p>

<h1>MOTIVATION FOR THE WORK</h1>
<br>
Being from a science background student I observed many of my friends,seniors pursing for 
engineering. Observing students around my college everyone is busy is learning new skills,
techniques for good placements but still many of them are struggling hard to develop good 
apttitue skill , lack of guidance is also stoping them from making a effective road map for 
overcoming this problem, We will develop a discord server that will be a real time data 
management with updating of all the free courses without wasting time of students on different 
browsers. The only significant costs will be your time and energy. While growing with these 
skills every individual is suffering from stressful situation in order to relax and be calm and 
produce productive work, We are building a music bot because music opens up a whole new 
world of experience that further enhances the mind, physical coordination, and expression. By 
joining our server students will interact with different students, seniors which will provide 
them a good guidance and tips.
<br>
<h1>OBJECTIVE OF THE WORK</h1>
<br>
<p>Establishing a platform where students will be informed about all the free courses from all the 
website like cousera, udemy etc. We will update them with the latest notification so that they 
can register for the free courses.</p>
<br>
<p>Keep individuals far from stressful situations and produce productive work by creating a 
musical environment which will relax their mind and make them feel positive. Boosting their
energy and enthusiasm towards there career.</p><br>
Providing affordable and flexible way to learn new skills and emerging topics to build a good 
resume and make them ready for their interviews for good placements and good lifestyles.</p><br>

equally. One member was supposed to read the research papers and was provided with 
documentation work. Second member was created the server, made various channels, added
